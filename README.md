# leap-year
<b>This is a homework practice problem for PIC 10A.</b>
<br />
<br />
We can tell if a year is a leap year if it is divisble by 4. However, there are some exceptions: 1) years that are divisible by 400 are also leap years, and 2) years that are divisible by 100 are NOT leap years. In other words, if a year is divisible by 4 and divisble by 400, it is a leap year. If a year is divisible by 4 but not by 400 but divisible by 100, it is not a leap year. If a year is divisible by 4 but not by 400 and not by 100, it is a leap year.
